**This is HTML directly imported from the code sample living elsewhere in the repository:**

{!./src/js/primary_monitoring/index.html!}
<script>{!./src/js/primary_monitoring/boilerplate.js!}</script>
<script>{!./src/js/primary_monitoring/demo.js!}</script>

## Code sample from file:

This code sample is directly pulled in from the `src` folder in this repo's root directory. It is NOT included in the markdown but instead directly rendered from the source file, meaning that any updates and changes are taken straight 'from the source'.

```JavaScript tab='JS'
{!./src/js/primary_monitoring/demo.js!}
```
